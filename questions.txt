1 , 1 , What is the representation of the third element in an array called a? , a[2] , a(2) , a[3] , a(3) , Array subscripts start at 0 and count up, so the 1st element is in subscript 0 and the 2nd element is in subscript 1 etc
1 , 2 , If you declare an array double[] list = {3.4, 2.0, 3.5, 5.5}, list[1] is ________. , 2.0 , 3.4 , 3.5 , 5.5 , Array subscripts start at 0 and count up, so the 1st element is in subscript 0 and the 2nd element is in subscript 1 etc
1 , 3 , What is the correct term for numbers[99]? , indexed variable, index, index variable, array variable , The index of an array element is the number in the brackets, In the example, alpha[2] = 3, 2 is the index and 3 is the variable stored at index 2
1 , 4 , When you return an array from a method, the method returns __________. , the reference of the array , a copy of the array , a copy of the first element , the length of the array ,  When you pass an array to a different method, the reference to that array is copied. Any changes in the content of array through that reference will affect the original array. Changing the reference to point to a new array will not change the existing reference in original method.
1 , 5 , The JVM stores the array in an area of memory, called _______, which is used for dynamic memory allocation where blocks of memory are allocated and freed in an arbitrary order. , heap , stack , memory block , dynamic memory , No matter, where the object is created in code e.g. as member variable, local variable or class variable, they are always created inside heap space in Java. The heap is where memory is allocated for objects, which in turn is referred to as heap memory. 
1 , 6 , Assume int[] t = {1, 2, 3, 4}. What is t.length? , 4 , 3 , 5 , 0 , Getting the length of an array displays how many elements are in the array
1 , 7 , Which of the following is incorrect? , int[] a = new int(2); , int a[] = new int[2]; , int[] a = new int[2]; , int[] a = {3, 2, 5, 7}; , To make an array object in java, you must state the data type followed by square brackets and the variable name, and set it equal to a new object of that datatype with square brackets following it stating the size of the array
1 , 8 , Analyze the following code:\nint[] list = new int[5];\nlist = new int[6]; ,  The code can compile and run fine. The second line assigns a new array to 'list' , The code has compile errors because the variable list cannot be changed once it is assigned , The code has runtime errors because the variable list cannot be changed once it is assigned , The code has compile errors because you cannot assign a different size array to 'list'

2 , 1 , Each pass through a loop is called a/an , iteration , enumeration , pass through , loop through , iteration is the repetition of a procsess.
2 , 2 , In a nested loop , which loop is executed the most times? , inner loop , outerloop , both are the same , non are executed , the inner loop as it is repeated as many times as itself and the outter loop
2 , 3 , in a for looop what is the equivilant of i++ , i-- , i+i , i+1 , i+1 , i-1 , beceause you increase i by one everytime you iterate.  
2, 4 , in a for loop what allows you to check array size?,.length,.matches,.split,.length as you need the length of the array.
2,5, What's wrong?  for (int k = 2, k <= 12, k++),there should be a semicolon at the end,there should be full stop at the end,the commas should be semicolons,correct the commas should be semicolons
2,6, What's wrong?  while( (i < 10) && (i > 24), the while loop is an exit-condition loop,the test condition is always false,the test condition is always true, the condition is always false
2,7,Which of the following operators are right-associative,*,+,=,%,= is the correct answer
2,8,in a loop what would you use {} for?,to hold a block of conditions together,to create an array,to prevent errors,to hold a block of condition 
2,9,What value is stored in num at the end of this looping? for (num = 1; num <= 5; num++),4,5,6,6 is stored in num
2,10, What is wrong? for (j = 1;j <= 5; j+),J+,<=,=,J+ is supposed to be J++

3 , 1 , "abc".compareTo("aba") returns ___________. , 2 , 1 , 0 , -1 , when .compareTo is correct it returns 2.
3 , 2 , ____________________ returns true. , "peter".equalsIgnoreCase("Petre") , "peter".compareToIgnoreCase("peter") , "peter".equalsIgnoreCase("Peter") , "petre".equalsIgnoreCase("Peter") , equalsIgnoreCase returns a boolean.
3 , 3 , What is the return value of "SELECT".substring(0, 5)? , "SELEC" , "SELECT" , "SELE" , "ELECT" , it starts from the S (0) and stops right before C (5) spot
3 , 4 , What is the return value of "SELECT".substring(4, 4)? , an empty string , C , T , E , The Begin Index must be smaller than the endIndex , it creates a runtime error if they are the same
3 , 5 , Which of the following is the correct statement to return JAVA? , "Java".toUpperCase() , "Java".toUpperCase("Java") , String.toUpperCase("Java") , toUpperCase("Java") , toUpperCase is a method that that does not intak anything to its brackets
3 , 6 , Which of the following is the correct statement to return a string from an array a of characters? , new String(a) , toString(a) , convertToString(a) , String.toString(a) , Its the way java works
3 , 7 , Assume s is " abc " , the method __________ returns a new string "abc". , s.trim(),String.trim(s) , trim(s) , s.trim(s) , the methods trim does not take in anything within its brackets
3 , 8 , Assume s is "ABCABC" , the method __________ returns a new string "aBCaBC". , s.replace('A', 'a') , s.toLowerCase() , s.toLowerCase(s) , s.replace('a', 'A') , The letter you're replacing goes first within the method
3,9,Assume s is "ABCABC", the method __________ returns an array of characters.,s.toCharArray(),toChars(s),String.toChars(),String.toCharArray(), the method toChars does take in a string
3,10,Which of following is not a correct method in Character?,isDigit(),isLetterOrDigit(char),isLetter(char),toLowerCase(char), isDigit() should be isDigit(char)
